# weather-advisory-app

This program displays the weather forecast and temperature for the city the user inputs.

This program makes two API calls to OpenWeather's api's (One call API & Geocode API), grabs the api's json data, accesses it via Python dictionary methods to grab the temperature and weather, converts to F/C and displays a message to the user what the weather conditions are in the destination city
